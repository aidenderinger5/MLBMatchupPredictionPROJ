# MLBMatchupPredictionPROJ

The goal of this project was to predict 2 different things given a pitcher-batter matchup that the user inputs- the pitch sequence and final pitch result. The pitch sequence is considered to be both the pitch result (ball, walk, hit by pitch, etc.) as well as the pitch type (4-Seam Fast Ball, Slider, etc.), and the final pitch result is considered to be the final result of the matchup (strikeout, single, walk, home run, etc.). 

This project uses pybaseball statcast data and baseball savant data as it's backbone.
